			<h1>Devlog #2: Welcome to the "Birthplace" - A Living Character Creator</h1>
			
			<p>Hey everyone! <em>Back to Thawing Valley</em>'s Devlog #2 is finally here!</p>
			
			<p>For the past few weeks, we've focused all our energy on a crucial system: the character's "birthplace" — our multi-page character creator (<code>PlayerSetup.tscn</code>).</p>
			
			<p>We wanted it to be more than just a function, but rather like flipping through a book about yourself, opening the first chapter of your story in the valley.</p>

			<p>The Appearance (Page 1) functionality is now locked in. We plan to gradually add more clothing and appearance options in the future!</p>

			<h3>Core Interaction</h3>
			<p>The core of this creator is making the UI "smarter." On the Questionnaire (Page 2), you can freely choose your "family" or festival invitees.</p>
			
			<p>Of course, <strong>we didn't forget our lone wolf players</strong>!</p>
			
			<p>If you choose not to invite anyone... the system will "read" your choice and give you special feedback. We hope to make the interaction feel warmer through these small details.</p>

			<h3>Flavor & Immersion: Your Uniqueness</h3>
			<p>We've added many "flavor" questions, hoping to cater to everyone's uniqueness.</p>
			
			<p>Maybe you prefer <strong>fishing late at night</strong> instead of farming at dawn? (Pictured: the Body Clock icons).</p>

			<p>Let us know your birthday. Maybe someone in the valley will secretly send you a gift!</p>

			<h3>Still Exploring Art...</h3>
			<p>Besides code, I'm also working hard to improve the game's art style!</p>
			
			<p>Although I'm not ready to show it off, I wanted to share two recent practice drawings. They won't necessarily be in the final game, but I hope to see my own progress!</p>

			<h3>Tech & Polish</h3>
			<p>Of course, this sprint also involved a lot of bug fixes and under-the-hood optimization.</p>
			
			<p>We refactored the UI layout, completely resolved the <strong>camera <code>current</code> property override issue</strong> during F6 previews (previously known as the "camera offset bug"), and optimized the scene tree's rendering order to fix a layering issue where buttons under the <code>NinePatchRect</code> (book background) couldn't be clicked.</p>
			
			<p>While this is all work the player won't see, it's the foundation for a smooth-running system.</p>

			<h3>Next Steps: Tilling!</h3>
			<p>With the core features of the character creator locked in, we can finally step into the valley and start building the real game loop!</p>
			
			<p>The goal for our next sprint (Devlog #3) is:<br>
			<strong>To let the player swing a hoe and plant the first seed!</strong></p>
			
			<p>Thanks for following along, and see you next time!</p>
